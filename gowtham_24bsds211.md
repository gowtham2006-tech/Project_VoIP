# SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL (SIP)
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) designed to initiate and terminate VoIP session with one or more participant (Rakesh, 2000), (Mona &, Nirmala, 2002). It is an ASCII-based peer to peer application protocol that initiates, modifies, creates and terminates interactive multimedia communication session between users. Because of the flexibility of SIP, it is used for audio, video and data packet transmission and communication. Session Initiation Protocol is similar to hypertext transfer protocol (http) made up of client-server. The client sends a request to the server and the server process the request and sends back to the client in a process called transaction. SIP is used in applications such as instant messaging, Apple chart, MSN messenger. The use of User description protocol (SDP) for carrying out negotiation for codec identification enables the support for user mobility by proxy and redirect server to the userâ€™s current location.
